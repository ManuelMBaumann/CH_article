  abstract = {We present two minimum residual methods for solving sequences of shifted
	linear systems, the right-preconditioned shifted GMRES and shifted
	Recycled GMRES algorithms. These methods are compatible with general
	preconditioning of all systems, and when restricted to right preconditioning,
	require no extra applications of the operator or preconditioner.
	These methods perform a minimum residual iteration for the base system
	while improving the approximations for the shifted systems at little
	additional cost. The iteration continues until the base system approximation
	is of satisfactory quality. The method is then recursively called
	for the remaining unconverged systems. We present both methods inside
	of a general framework which allows these techniques to be extended
	to the setting of flexible preconditioning and inexact Krylov methods.
	We present some analysis of such methods and numerical experiments
	demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms we have derived.},
